1.) Assembly is a low level language that uses no libraries etc.

2.) Assembly gives direct and complete control over system hardware.

3.) Assembly language programs are not user-friendly. Learning the assembly is more 
difficult than learning a high level langauge like Java. Programming in the assembly language 
is a tedious and error-prone procress. High-level languages should be natural preference for 
common applications.

4.) High level language programs are user-friendly, low levels are not. In high-level 
languages, the program development is faster, fewer lines of code, and the program 
maintenance is easier.

5.) Java is high level language, because it uses libraries and has a more complex syntax

6.) Assembly is low level language, because it uses no libraries and is easy for the computer
