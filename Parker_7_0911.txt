What is psuedocode? and what is it good for?
More specifically - Why will we use it?
What about the steps of problem solving?
Psuedocode is fake code that allows people to see the logical steps behind the
code before you put it into the computer readable format. Psuedocode is used 
for problem solving by allowing to see what you will do to replace the tainted
code.
