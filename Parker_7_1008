What are your tentative thoughts / plans for your art project?
My thoughts and plans are to create a program that is unique each time but always appealing
What might be methods you will use?
I'm planning incorporate methods to check fill colors and areas of the shapes to make sure they
appear scattered about, rather than in clusters
How might you incorporate a for loop?
I will use a loop for the majority of the project to create the art
How might you incorporate, if, else if, else?
I will use if statements to check to see if a shape is a certain color and place them accordingly
What math might you use? 
I will use an addition counter to make the shapes organized in a unique fashion as well as keeping
colors out
