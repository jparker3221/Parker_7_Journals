Some students may indicate "just give me teh codez [sic], I don;t want to practice organizing
my thoughts."
How would you explain the importance of organizing one's thoughts and not proceeding in a

Organizing your thoughts and developing a plan is extremely important in any activity, especially
in coding where one mistake ruins the entire program. This thought process will lead to errors
and cause the coder to be unsuccessful in his work.
