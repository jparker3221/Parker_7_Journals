We have made it so a potentiometer can be turned and change the pitch of the piezzo
buzzer.

We need to configure a bit of the code.

We will be able to turn in my arduino and code. I am going to add one more function to my 
design allowing the color to change.

We am making new functions.

We have created one to be called to change the pitch.
