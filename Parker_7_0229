  boolean isGlazed;
  boolean hasJelly;
  float temperature;
  public Donut(boolean a, boolean b, float c){
    this.isGlazed = a;
    this.hasJelly = b;
    this.temperature = c;
  }
  // a getter gets and returns a variable value
  // usually is a public method to get a private value
  public float getTemperature(){
    return this.Temperature
  }
  public boolean getHasJelly(){
    return this.hasJelly
  }
  public void setTemperature(float c){
    this.Temperature = c;
  }
  public void setHasJelly(boolean a){
    this.hasJelly = a;
  }
}

 4. Explain in your own words - what is a getter? what does it do?

 6. What is in An array of Breakfast? How would you create one?
int[] coolNumbers; //array of ints
string[] coolWords; //array of strings
boolean[][] blocked; //2d array of booleans
Breakfast[] JarzombekFamilyBreakfast;
Breakfast Joseph = new Breakfast(4,8,2,true);
Breakfast Sarah = new Breakfast(2,0,0,true);
Breakfast Papa = new Breakfast(4,8,8,false);
Breakfast Mama = new Breakfast(3,0,0,false);
JarzombekFamily Breakfast = {Joseph, Sarah, Papa, Mama};
