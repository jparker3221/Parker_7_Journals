    this.hasJelly = b;
    this.temperature = c;
  }
  // a getter gets and returns a variable value
  // usually is a public method to get a private value
  public float getTemperature(){
    return this.Temperature
  }
  public boolean getHasJelly(){
    return this.hasJelly
  }
  public void setTemperature(float c){
    this.Temperature = c;
