What slick game did you create?
I created Temper Tantrum Simulator 2016
What challenges did you solve
My map had multiple issues, first having a redesign when i changed themes, and a faulty spritesheet
Before the Winter break, you were admonished to finish your maps and spritesheets- 
so that you would be ready to go with the game when we got back. Did you? Why or why not?
I was ready, but due to the change in time and realizing my software restrictions i had to 
change my map and my spritesheet to fit the theme
Were you able to meet the timeline? Why or why not?
[Focus on what you did or did not do. Journals ascribing blame to others will not be considered.
No, I had to much to recreate in a short period of time and ran into many issues along the way that i had to solve, like my tileset
