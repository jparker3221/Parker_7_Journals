During / after the holiday, we will be constructing "dungeon crawlers" (or side-scrollers).

Describe the 2-D dungeon or world you would like to have for your game.
I would like a game similar to super meat boy, with interesting mechanics and a high difficulty
Why?
A game needs to be unique and this high difficulty with unique never before seen mechanics will create a special game like braid 
paper mario and fez were.
