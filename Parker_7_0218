Explain this code:
public Animation Playeranime, up, down, left, right, sprite, wait;
    public Player() throws SlickException {
        SpriteSheet runningSS = new SpriteSheet(
                "res/ogrespritesheet.png", 64, 64, 0);
        up = new Animation();
        up.setAutoUpdate(true);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(0, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(1, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(2, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(3, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(4, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(5, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(6, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(7, 8), 330);
        up.addFrame(runningSS.getSprite(8, 8), 330);
        
It declares an up animation taking pictures from the 8th row


Why would it be unproductive to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we were trying to practice?
Slick is not world spread and permanent, so we should focus on problem solving and pattern recognition to
get the most return on investment (ROI).

What is an array?
An array is an ordered collection of one datatype

How do we make an array?
string [] stringarray = {“string1, string2, string3”};
//creats an array with 3 different values
int [] myFavoriteNumbers = new int [42];
//creates an integer array 42 ints long, they have null values

What is an ArrayList?
An ArrayList can contain multiple data types, very similar to an array
To make an ArrayList with a specific type, we use <>
ArrayList<stuff> things = new ArrayList();
things.add(moreStuff);

What is the difference between an array and an ArrayList?
An array has a static size, whereas ArrayLists have dynamic sizes

How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
public float playerhealth = 500;
public boolean isAlive(){
if(playerhealth >= 0){
        return false;
}else{
return true;
}    
}
while(isAlive){
    health -= 2.5;
}
