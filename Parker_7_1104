What is a method?
A shortcut to a section of code.
Which methods did you use and how did you use them in your guessing game program?
I used methods to decide difficulty in my game.
What is a while loop?
a loop that loops code while a condition is true.
How did you use a while loop, boolean, and counter in your guessing game?
I used a while loop that ran while you were still "alive."
I used a boolean to see if playing again would run.
I used a counter to tick down the lives until you lose.
