We will have a test on Friday.
It will be about the notes from last week.
Are you ready? 
I believe I am sufficiently ready
What specific questions do you have about the Slick Game?
I have no questions
We will be revising our Slick game to:
1. Have multiple levels
2. Enemies
3. Traps (or something) with coordinates defined by an array.
4. Give and take damage
5. Score
6. Inventory or some compelling alternative.
What will you have to do to get this working?
add a new state, create traps, a scoring system etc
Are you prepared? Do you have all knowledge you need?
I have a few question on a visible inventory, but everything else i know
If not be specific.
