    The Slick assignment was intended to gently familiarize you with 2-D arrays. 
    Some students recognized the 2-D arrays from Slick and previous journals ---
    other students had no recollection. Which were you? Why? Note - attributing the environment is not pragmatic 
    - as students experienced the same environment (though they might have experienced it differently)
    I remembered bits of the code but not the fine details, I remembered the rest when i got back into the code.
    Make a list of ten questions related to the Array assignments pt 1 and 2 - 
    that you predict will be on the semester exam. E.g., object initialization, 
    class constructors, creating and changing arrays, etc.
  1: What is an array used for?
	2: How do you create an array?
	3: How would you change the value of an element of an array?
	4: What is a class used for?
	5: How do you create a class?
	6: How would you change the value of one variable?
	7: How do you make an instance of a class?
	8: What is and object and what is it used for?.
	9: How do you make a 2D array?
	10: What does Object Oriented Programming mean to you?
