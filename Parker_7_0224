Define a class Rat
public class Rat {
}
Provide the code to declare and instatiate Rats
public mouse Rat;
mouse = new Rat();
Explain where the decaration and initialization are placed
The declaration is just a setting aside of dataspace so it goes at the very beginning of his code.
The initialization goes in the init stages where things are initialized
Provode a two-dimensional array that specifies coordinates for five rats
int [] ratxXCoordinates = {15,60,80,120};
int [] ratYCoordinates = {50,60,40,30};
